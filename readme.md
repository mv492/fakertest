## My Understandings

1.	Installed the faker library with command ‘pip install faker’, deactivated the virtual environment and activated it again
2.	Tested the code with fake test records of 100 and all were passed successfully
3.	To test the data code is taking the a, b and operation function and checking with the expected if the expected is same as corresponding value then the test is passed.
4.	We are able to test the code 100 test records and also tried with 500 test records both were 100% successful.
